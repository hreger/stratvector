Architecture Overview
====================

System Components
---------------

StratVector is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and enables easy extension. The main components are:

1. Strategy Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The strategy engine is responsible for:
- Signal generation
- Position sizing
- Risk management
- Performance tracking

.. code-block:: python

   class Strategy:
       def generate_signals(self, data):
           """Generate trading signals from market data."""
           pass
           
       def calculate_position_sizes(self, signals):
           """Calculate position sizes based on signals and risk parameters."""
           pass

2. Backtesting Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The backtesting engine provides:
- Historical data simulation
- Transaction cost modeling
- Slippage simulation
- Performance analysis

.. code-block:: python

   class Backtester:
       def __init__(self, strategy, data_loader, risk_manager):
           self.strategy = strategy
           self.data_loader = data_loader
           self.risk_manager = risk_manager
           
       def run(self, start_date, end_date):
           """Run backtest simulation."""
           pass

3. Live Trading System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The live trading system handles:
- Market data streaming
- Order execution
- Position management
- Risk monitoring

.. code-block:: python

   class LiveTrader:
       def __init__(self, strategy, broker, risk_manager):
           self.strategy = strategy
           self.broker = broker
           self.risk_manager = risk_manager
           
       def run(self):
           """Run live trading system."""
           pass

4. Data Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data management system provides:
- Market data integration
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Portfolio analytics

.. code-block:: python

   class DataManager:
       def load_data(self, symbols, start_date, end_date):
           """Load market data for specified symbols and date range."""
           pass
           
       def preprocess_data(self, data):
           """Preprocess market data for strategy use."""
           pass

System Interactions
-----------------

   :align: center

1. Data Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Market data is loaded and preprocessed
- Strategy generates signals
- Position sizes are calculated
- Orders are executed
- Performance is tracked

2. Risk Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Position limits are enforced
- Risk metrics are calculated
- Stop losses are monitored
- Portfolio exposure is managed

3. Performance Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Real-time PnL tracking
- Risk metrics calculation
- Performance attribution
- Strategy health monitoring

Configuration
------------

The system is configured through TOML files:

.. code-block:: toml

   [strategy]
   name = "momentum"
   parameters = { lookback = 20, threshold = 0.02 }
   
   [risk]
   max_position_size = 0.15
   stop_loss = 0.05
   take_profit = 0.1
   
   [broker]
   name = "ib"
   host = "127.0.0.1"
   port = 7496

Deployment
---------

The system can be deployed in various environments:

1. Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Local development with Jupyter Lab
- Redis for caching
- PostgreSQL for data storage

2. Production
~~~~~~~~~~~

- AWS ECS for container orchestration
- ECR for container registry
- CloudWatch for monitoring
- RDS for database

3. Testing
~~~~~~~~~

- Paper trading environment
- Simulation mode
- Performance testing
- Integration testing
